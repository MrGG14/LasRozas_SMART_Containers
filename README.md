# LAS ROZAS SMART CONTAINERS AUTOMATITATION

The objective of this proyect is to intuitively display real-time information for each of the smart containers located in Las Rozas (Madrid). 

The primary stakeholder for this data will be the municipal government, as it will help optimize service efficiency and provide control over the various containers. The application's goal is to simplify data interpretation and organize it more effectively. The aim is to make real-time data available for each container and automate certain municipal services. The information displayed from the smart containers will be diverse, including:
* location
* recyclable materials
* total capacity
* fill percentage
* garbage collections

With this data, it will be possible to automate notifications to the garbage collection center when a certain garbage percentage is exceeded, thereby avoiding unnecessary services and scheduling pickups only when needed. Furthermore, valuable insights can be gained regarding what is being recycled the most and where, enabling the promotion of recycling in areas where lower recycling rates are detected.
